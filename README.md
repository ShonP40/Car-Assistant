## Installation

Follow these steps to get your Car Assistant device up and running with ESPHome.

### ESPHome Integration Setup

1. Install the ESPHome add-on in Home Assistant if not already installed:
   - Go to `Settings` → `Add-ons` → `Add-on Store`
   - Search for `ESPHome`
   - Click `Install`
2. Start the ESPHome add-on and verify that it's running
3. Access the ESPHome dashboard through Home Assistant

### Setup Device

1. In the ESPHome dashboard, click `+ New Device`
2. Name your device (e.g., "Car Assistant")
3. Select `ESP32` as your device type
4. Copy the default configuration to your new device from [here](./car-assistant.yaml)
5. Modify the configuration in the user config section
6. Click `Save` and then `Install`

### Device Flashing

Initial flashing must be done via serial connection.

[ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io) is recommended for the simplest experience.

#### Required Hardware
- USB-C to USB-A cable

#### Flashing Process
1. Connect the T-SIM7600E-L1C to a computer using a USB-C cable
2. Visit [ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io)
3. Connect to your device and flash the firmware you compiled earlier
4. After a successful flash, the device will restart and be ready for OTA updates

### Device Tracker
Import the device tracker blueprint into Home Assistant to display your car's location on the map

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FShonP40%2FCar-Assistant%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fgps_device_tracker.yaml)

### Recover from GPS failures
Import the restart on GPS failure blueprint into Home Assistant to automatically restart your Car Assistant's modem & ESP32 if GPS fails and does not recover
